### Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module and class has a single, well-defined purpose
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Modules are open for extension but closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Implementations can be substituted without breaking functionality
4. **Interface Segregation Principle**: Interfaces are focused and minimal
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Dependencies on abstractions rather than concrete implementations
